Heliostat Power a new form of solar power!
=========

Welcome to the combined works of Rakosmanjr and myself with Hirvio for the ride! Together we wish to bring you a new form of solar power. Expanded on the idea and concept used in Factorizations Solar Turbines. This mod will see the use of a more practical use of that glowy thing of hotness in our skies. THE SUN!

Using highly complex reflective arrays called Heliostats. Your suns rays are focused on a collection tower in the middle. Specialized wiring under the arrays connects the control system to the mirrors. Each mirror will automatically re-assign its position to the central tower. When enough mirrors are constructed you will need to feed the turbine reactor with caliche ore aka Sodium Phosphate. Then feed it water. Lots and lots of water. The collection tower will divert the collected force of the sun at the turbine tank and begin heating it to boiling. when hot enough the steam pressure will turn specialized turbines and crank out power for you. We recommend down stepping power from HV to MV as this power is immense.
